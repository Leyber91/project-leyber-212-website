# Space section I. Black hole animation project

This project aims to create a complex and engaging black hole animation using WebGL and Three.js. The animation will include an event horizon, accretion disk, gravitational lensing, particle systems, and various adjustable parameters.

1. **Setting up the 3D environment (Three.js Initialization)**
   - Initialize a new Three.js scene.
   - Set up the camera, renderer, controls, and other necessary components.
   - Add a basic geometry (e.g., a cube) to test the 3D environment.
   - Implement a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.

2. **Modeling the Black Hole (Event Horizon and Accretion Disk)**
   - Create a 3D model of the event horizon using a black sphere with a custom shader to simulate its properties.
   - Create a 3D model of the accretion disk using a custom geometry with adjustable parameters (e.g., inner and outer radii, thickness).
   - Add an animated swirl or vortex effect to the accretion disk texture to simulate its motion.
   - Add the black hole and accretion disk models to the Three.js scene.

3. **Enhancing the Scene (Lighting, Shadows, and Materials)**
   - Add ambient, point, and spotlights to the scene to create realistic lighting with adjustable parameters (e.g., color, intensity, distance).
   - Enable shadows for the objects and configure shadow properties (e.g., resolution, softness).
   - Apply appropriate materials with adjustable parameters (e.g., roughness, metalness) to the black hole and accretion disk models.
   - Create and apply a star field background to the scene.

4. **Gravitational Lensing (Custom Shaders and Post-Processing)**
   - Research and understand the math behind gravitational lensing.
   - Create custom vertex and fragment shaders to simulate the lensing effect with adjustable parameters (e.g., distortion strength, falloff distance).
   - Apply the custom shaders to the black hole model.
   - Implement post-processing effects (e.g., bloom, depth of field) to enhance the visual appearance of the scene.

5. **Animating the Accretion Disk (Particle System, Forces, and Jets)**
   - Create a particle system to represent the matter within the accretion disk.
   - Develop a function to apply forces, such as gravity and friction, to the particles with adjustable parameters (e.g., gravitational constant, friction coefficient).
   - Update the particle system in the animation loop to simulate the motion of the accretion disk.
   - Add relativistic jets to the black hole model, using particle systems and custom shaders to simulate their appearance and motion.

6. **Interactivity and User Experience (UI and Controls)**
   - Implement a user interface (UI) with controls to adjust the parameters of the black hole, accretion disk, lighting, and shaders.
   - Add interactive features, such as zooming, panning, and rotating the camera view.
   - Implement tooltips or help messages to guide users through the features and controls.

7. **Optimization and Compatibility (Performance and Cross-Device Support)**
   - Analyze and optimize the performance of the WebGL application using techniques such as level of detail (LOD), frustum culling, and texture compression.
   - Test the animation on various devices and browsers to ensure smooth rendering.
   - Implement fallback solutions for devices or browsers that do not support WebGL or specific features.
   - Consider using a Progressive Web App (PWA) approach to improve the user experience on mobile devices.
