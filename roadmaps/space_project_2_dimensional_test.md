# Dimensional Test Roadmap:

## Stage 1: Research and Planning

- Investigate existing methods of visualizing higher dimensions (4D, 5D, etc.)
- Determine which dimensional concepts will be most engaging and accessible for your audience
- Develop a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of the project

## Stage 2: Design and Prototyping

- Create initial designs and mockups for the dimensional visualization tool
- Develop a user interface that is intuitive and visually appealing
- Prototype different approaches to visualize higher-dimensional concepts, such as tesseracts and other geometric figures

## Stage 3: Development and Implementation

- Begin development of the dimensional visualization tool, incorporating the chosen design and visualizations
- Implement user interaction features, such as zooming, rotating, and exploring the higher-dimensional figures
- Test and optimize the tool for performance, ensuring a smooth user experience

## Stage 4: Content Creation and Integration

- Develop educational content explaining the concepts of higher dimensions and their significance in various fields (e.g., physics, mathematics)
- Integrate the content with the visualization tool, creating a cohesive and engaging user experience
- Continuously update the content as new research and discoveries are made in the field of higher dimensions

## Stage 5: Launch, Promotion, and Community Building

- Launch the dimensional visualization tool on your website and promote it through social media, newsletters, and other marketing channels
- Encourage users to share their experiences and discoveries with the tool, fostering a community of curious learners
- Continuously gather user feedback and iterate on the tool to improve its functionality, usability, and overall appeal


# Hypercubes

A hypercube is a geometric figure with multiple dimensions. The most commonly known hypercube is the tesseract, which is a 4-dimensional cube. Here are some other hypercubes:

- [x] **4D - Tesseract:** A tesseract can be thought of as a cube within a cube. So, the wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of two cubes that are nested within each other.

- [x]**5D - Penteract:** A penteract can be thought of as a hypercube with five dimensions. It can be visualized as a cube with a smaller cube attached to each of its vertices. The wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of the larger cube, as well as the vertices and edges of the smaller cubes attached to it.

- [x]**6D - Hexeract:** A hexeract can be thought of as a hypercube with six dimensions. It can be visualized as a cube with a smaller cube attached to each of its edges. The wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of the larger cube, as well as the vertices and edges of the smaller cubes attached to its edges.

- [x]**7D - Hepteract:** A hepteract can be thought of as a hypercube with seven dimensions. It can be visualized as a cube with a smaller cube attached to each of its faces. The wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of the larger cube, as well as the vertices and edges of the smaller cubes attached to its faces.

- [x]**8D - Octeract:** An octeract can be thought of as a hypercube with eight dimensions. It can be visualized as a cube with a smaller cube attached to each of its cubes. The wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of the larger cube, as well as the vertices and edges of the smaller cubes attached to its cubes.

- [x]**9D - Enneract:** An enneract can be thought of as a hypercube with nine dimensions. It can be visualized as a cube with a smaller cube attached to each of its tesseracts. The wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of the larger cube, as well as the vertices and edges of the smaller cubes attached to its tesseracts.

- [x]**10D - Deceract:** A deceract can be thought of as a hypercube with ten dimensions. It can be visualized as a cube with a smaller cube attached to each of its pentaracts. The wireframe representation would show the vertices and edges of the larger cube, as well as the vertices and edges of the smaller cubes attached to its pentaracts.
